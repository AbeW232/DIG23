// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaring or importing them.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual fix based on the original code.

const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct initialization or import
const it = null // Replace null with the correct initialization or import
const is = null // Replace null with the correct initialization or import
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct initialization or import
const and = null // Replace null with the correct initialization or import

// The rest of the original code would go here, using the declared variables.
// Example usage (replace with actual code):
console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)

// Please replace this entire block with the actual content of the original
// components/admin/shared/legacy-status-badge.tsx file,
// and then integrate the variable declarations at the appropriate location
// based on how these variables are used in the original code.
