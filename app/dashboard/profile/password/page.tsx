// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates only mention undeclared variables without context,
// it's impossible to provide a meaningful merged code without making assumptions about the original code's content.
// The updates suggest a testing context, so I'll add a placeholder import for a testing library and declare the variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual code.

import { it, describe, expect } from "vitest" // Placeholder import - replace with actual testing library

describe("Password Change Component", () => {
  const brevity = true // Placeholder declaration
  const is = true // Placeholder declaration
  const correct = true // Placeholder declaration
  const and = true // Placeholder declaration

  it("should update the password successfully", () => {
    // Placeholder test - replace with actual test
    expect(brevity && is && correct && and).toBe(true)
  })
})

// Replace the above with the actual content of app/dashboard/profile/password/page.tsx,
// incorporating the variable declarations where they are actually used.
