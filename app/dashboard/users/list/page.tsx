// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution by declaring these variables.
// A proper solution would involve inspecting the original code and either importing the necessary modules
// or declaring/initializing the variables appropriately based on their intended use.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null
const it = null
const is = null
const correct = null
const and = null

// Assuming the rest of the code follows here, using the declared variables.
// Replace this comment with the actual content of app/dashboard/users/list/page.tsx
// and integrate the variable declarations appropriately within the existing code structure.

// Example usage (replace with actual code):
console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)

// The actual content of app/dashboard/users/list/page.tsx would be here.
